//Daniel H: I will update all Top navbars and any edits and responsiveness towards Home and About page
### Jacob's Review

##### Desktop
Tested at 1920px

###### Home Page
- Nav links are too far apart and too far from the right
- Muzzles triple image does not reach the ends of the container
- Muzzles text is too large.

###### About Page
- About section is too thin, the prototype shows the image and story behind the grill section as wider
- The Our Team title is wider than the other two sections
- The our team cards are rounded when the prototype does not show that
- Our team card text is either too small

###### Menu Page  (DONE)                                         CHANGES HERE
- Menu cards are rounded when they should not be                    (done)
- Too much space between Our Menu title and cards                   (done)
- Card title description text should be italicized            (i think its done?)
- Card background color does not match prototype                    (done)
- Price text is too small                                         (adjusted)
- Lines under menu items are too thick                      (from 2px down to 1px)
- Too much space between each card                      (fixed from 40px gap down to 15px)

###### Catering Page
- Catering title is wider than the rest of the page
- Our Catering Services section is too tall (image should be rectangular a square.)
- Text for Our Catering Services differs in styling from prototype
- Text for Our Catering Services is slit at the wrong part, and has an extra P at the (false) start of the second paragraph
###### Photo Page
- Photos title is wider than the rest of the page


##### Tablet
Tested at 768px
For the most part has the same spacing issues as Desktop, but some are more noticeable on Tablet

###### Home Page 
- Nav links (for the hamburger menu) have too much space between them 
###### Photo Page
- Could have the photos go to 3 (or 2) columns instead of 4

##### Mobile
Tested at 425px

###### Menu Page (DONE)
- Lessen the margins on the sides of the menu cards, to make them wider. Could get rid of the side margins completely if you want 
(Fixed for the most part)
- Menu card text is way way too small. Usually we do not make text smaller on mobile. This causes readability issues. 
(fixed so text doesnt leave menu and is still readable on mobile)
- Footer differs from the home and about pages
(fixed!)

###### Photo Page
- I would not consider this page responsive
- Images have too much border and space between them
- At this level definitely lessen the amount of columns the are arranged in
- Footer overlaps with images
