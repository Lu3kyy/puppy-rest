 // Puppy Restaurant 

 // Recreating a puppy restaurant from the adobe preview and making sure its 1:1

// Peer review on assignment: Sammer Saqa - Home(Index) link missing on all pages, shows to be   
   fully responsive, however the mobile dimensions show that the images are not centered on the about page. The photos page borders around each picture are too thick. Catering page images are to far apart, they need to be brought closer. Font sizes are a bit larger than the adobe. 

   All and all, looks great. Just needs a few tweaks. 

   (index button is within the logo i just dont think it was clicked during review)
   just some smaller tweaks to sizing is all we really need.

###### Home Page (Done DH)

- Card background color does not match prototype                    (done)
- Price text is too small                                         (adjusted)

###### Catering Page
- Catering title is wider than the rest of the page                                                                                     (done)
- Our Catering Services section is too tall (image should be rectangular a square.)                                                     (done)
- Text for Our Catering Services differs in styling from prototype                                                                      (done)

###### Photo Page
- Photos title is wider than the rest of the page      (done)                                                                             


##### Tablet
Tested at 768px
For the most part has the same spacing issues as Desktop, but some are more noticeable on Tablet

###### Home Page (DONE)
- Nav links (for the hamburger menu) have too much space between them                       : DH (Decreased space between nav links)
###### Photo Page (DONE)
- Could have the photos go to 3 (or 2) columns instead of 4  (LG: made it sized at 3 columns 4 rows and hold all images perfectly)

##### Mobile (DONE)
Tested at 425px

###### Menu Page (DONE)
- Lessen the margins on the sides of the menu cards, to make them wider. Could get rid of the side margins completely if you want 
                                        (Fixed for the most part)
- Menu card text is way way too small. Usually we do not make text smaller on mobile. This causes readability issues. 
                        (fixed so text doesnt leave menu and is still readable on mobile)
- Footer differs from the home and about pages
                                                (fixed!)

###### Photo Page (DONE - Jacob checked it off)
- I would not consider this page responsive                                                     
- Images have too much border and space between them
- At this level definitely lessen the amount of columns the are arranged in
- Footer overlaps with images
