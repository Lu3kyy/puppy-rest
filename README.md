//Daniel H: I will update all Top navbars and any edits and responsiveness towards Home and About page
### Jacob's Review

##### Desktop
Tested at 1920px

###### Home Page
- Nav links are too far apart and too far from the right
- Muzzles triple image does not reach the ends of the container
- Muzzles text is too large.

###### About Page
- About section is too thin, the prototype shows the image and story behind the grill section as wider
- The Our Team title is wider than the other two sections
- The our team cards are rounded when the prototype does not show that
- Our team card text is either too small

###### Menu Page
- Menu cards are rounded when they should not be
- Too much space between Our Menu title and cards
- Card title description text should be italicized
- Card background color does not match prototype
- Price text is too small
- Lines under menu items are too thick
- Too much space between each card

###### Catering Page
- Catering title is wider than the rest of the page
- Our Catering Services section is too tall (image should be rectangular a square.)
- Text for Our Catering Services differs in styling from prototype
- Text for Our Catering Services is slit at the wrong part, and has an extra P at the (false) start of the second paragraph
###### Photo Page
- Photos title is wider than the rest of the page


##### Tablet
Tested at 768px
For the most part has the same spacing issues as Desktop, but some are more noticeable on Tablet

###### Home Page 
- Nav links (for the hamburger menu) have too much space between them 
###### Photo Page
- Could have the photos go to 3 (or 2) columns instead of 4

##### Mobile
Tested at 425px

###### Menu Page
- Lessen the margins on the sides of the menu cards, to make them wider. Could get rid of the side margins completely if you want
- Menu card text is way way too small. Usually we do not make text smaller on mobile. This causes readability issues.
- Footer differs from the home and about pages

###### Photo Page
- I would not consider this page responsive
- Images have too much border and space between them
- At this level definitely lessen the amount of columns the are arranged in
- Footer overlaps with images
